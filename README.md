# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview:

The purpose of this project was to break down tons of data pertaining to employees, departments, date of employment, dates of retirement, and projected openings available when other employees hit retirement. This analysis is very powerful because it allows the company to strategically plan how to handle the mass amounts of employees that are projected to retire so that the company isn't left with major postions open and no manager to run their department or employees to keep their business running either.

PROCESS:

I have used SQL, PgAdmin, Visual Studios, Python, and QuickDBD to combine, clean, mend, and distribute my data into comprehensible tables and csv files to provide this employer with multiple sets of data as requested. 

Results:
- [x] seperated retiring employees based on their title held with the company.

- [x] Quick overview after breaking down department info, manager info, and retirement titles show that there are a few departments that don't have specific managers assigned to those departments and many employees that are counted multiple times due to their change in title status from various departments or advancements.

- [x] Helped break down the future retiring employees and determine if they were eligible for a mentorship. This allows the retiring employees to slowly retire and also give an opportunity for the employees graduating into that position a chance to learn from a seasoned employee that is experienced.

Summary:

Observing the number of employees (thousands) per department (9) and the lack of managers (5 total managers) - also there are 90,000+ employees retiring in total with a miniscule 1,549 eligible for mentorship.

Although, the concept of having the retiring employees mentor the employees who are going to fill their spot is ideal - it is not practical. This concept is dependant on all eligible employees to stay working and not completely retire. This also on the other hand assumes all employees that hit retirement age , are actually going to retire and leave. I think seperating the retiring employess by who are going to retire sooner rather than later and offer (if applicable) those employees management/supervisor positions to give them an insentive to stay and properly train those moving up in the company. 

Potentially creating workshops so that one mentor could potentially teach multiple employees at a time to move into higher more desireable positions is also a good idea - it allows a more productive use of one mentor.
