# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview:

The purpose of this project was to break down tons of data pertaining to employees, departments, date of employment, dates of retirement, and projected openings available when other employees hit retirement. This analysis is very powerful because it allows the company to strategically plan how to hand the mass amounts of employees that are projected to retire so that the company isn't left with major postions open and no manager to run their department.

PROCESS:

I have used SQL, PgAdmin, Visual Studios, Python, and QuickDBD to combine, clean, mend, and distribute my data into comprehensible tables and csv files to provide this employer with multiple sets of data as requested. 

Results:
- [x] seperated retiring employees based on their title held with the company.
- [x] Gave existing managers ideas of how many openings will be available in their particular department.
- [x] Helped break down the future retiring employees and determine if they were eligible for a mentorship. This allows the retiring employees to slowly retire and also give an opportunity for the employees graduating into that position a chance to learn from a seasoned employee that is experienced. 
 
Summary:
 There are __ roles needing to be filled.
 
 According to my mentorship eligibilty table -  there are ]___ experienced retiring employees in various departments to be able to mentor the graduating employees.
